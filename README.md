- 👋 Hi, I’m @JeffJames1
- 👀 I’m interested in embedded analytics, Tableau, Business Objects, and BI architecture
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python as an ongoing project. Rarely enough time to focus on coding
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of my repos. Maybe on projects that extend Tableau, but time is a precious commodity
- 📫 How to reach me @EmbeddedViz on Twitter, or jeffjames1@gmail.com
